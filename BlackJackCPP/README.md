Just a normal blackjack game unless Ms. Tina ask me to modify the code.
Play against the dealer, following standard blackjack rules:
Get as close as 21 (<=21) to win the game against the dealer.
Enter "h" for hit to add a card, and "s" to stand to stop player's turn.
If the total of player's cards goes over 21, player is busted and loses the game.
If the total of player's cards is larger than the dealer's cards, and not larger than 21, player wins.
If the total of dealer's cards goes over 21, dealer is busted and loses the game.
If the total of dealer's cards is larger than the player's cards, and not larger than 21, dealer wins.
